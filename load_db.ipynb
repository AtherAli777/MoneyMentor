      "* **Pack your lunch:** Eating out for lunch every day adds up quickly. Bringing your own lunch, even a few times a week, can make a big difference.\n",
      "* **Explore affordable grocery options:** Look for deals, compare prices, and consider buying in bulk for staples you use regularly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Transportation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Track your spending:**  For a month, keep a record of how much you spend on transportation. This will reveal areas to potentially cut back.\n",
      "* **Consider alternatives:**  If possible, walk, bike, or use public transportation more often, especially for shorter trips.\n",
      "* **Carpool or rideshare:** If you drive frequently, see if you can share rides with colleagues or friends to split costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**General Saving Tips:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Set a budget:**  Create a plan for your money each month. Allocate specific amounts for different categories, including savings.\n",
      "* **Automate your savings:**  Set up an automatic transfer to your savings account each month. This makes saving effortless.\n",
      "* **Find small wins:** Look for little ways to save in your daily life. These small amounts add up over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reaching your Goal:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To save ₹10,000, you could aim to save around ₹2,500 per month. This is achievable with your income and expenses. \n",
